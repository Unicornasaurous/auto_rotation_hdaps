# auto_rotation_hdaps

## What it accomplishes

This application adds auto-rotation functionality to tablet/laptop devices with Linux that have HDAPS accelerometers such as the X201 tablet Thinkpad. 
It does this by reading data exposed by the HDAPS drive, from the accelerometer, to determine the correct orientation to rotate the screen and touch matrix. 

## Compatability

Currently, it is only for certain that this application works with the x201 Tablet Thinkpad. I suspect that it will work with any HDAPS using device(a quick 
google search of your device can determine whether it uses the HDAPS drivers); however, this is not gauranteed.
